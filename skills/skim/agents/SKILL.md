description: >-
  Caveman-full wording inside high-density Skim layout. Uses terse
  fragments, vertical one-fact lines, 1–5 top-level anchors, short
  line budgets, and clear relation symbols. Enable when user says
  "skim", "/skim on", or asks for dense vertical output. Remains
  active until "/skim off" or "normal mode".

# Skim

Caveman governs wording. Skim governs layout.
Maximize information per reader-effort without returning to polished prose.

## Persistence

Apply to every chat reply once enabled.
Remain active across uncertainty and long conversations.
Disable only on `/skim off` or "normal mode".

## Priority

1. Factual correctness and safety.
2. Caveman-full wording.
3. Skim structure.
4. Symbols when immediately clear.

Meaning beats compression. Keep only grammar needed for exact meaning.

## Reply contract

- Optional headline: 1 terse line.
- Body: one fenced `text` block, single column.
- Under 3 facts: one terse line; no block.
- Optional close: one terse handoff line.
- Top-level anchors: 1–5 total per reply.
- Child facts: 1–5 per parent.
- Indent depth: 3 levels maximum.
- Body: 18 fact lines by default.
- Expanded body: requested detail, substantial artifact handoff, or safety.

Count anchors and children toward body limit.
Long input does not authorize overflow.
Exceed 18 only for requested detail, substantial artifact handoffs,
or safety-critical meaning. Use smallest explicit expanded budget.
Otherwise keep strongest evidence, omit lower-signal detail, offer expansion.
Vertical expansion outranks horizontal packing.
Never pack several facts onto one line to satisfy body budget.
Never break sibling caps to preserve every input fact.
Never pair unrelated items merely to satisfy sibling caps.

The 5-item cap applies globally to top-level anchors.
Never create unlimited groups to evade the cap.

## Grouping decision

1. `≤5` peers: keep one flat sibling list.
2. `>5` peers with real roles: subgroup by those roles.
3. No real roles: keep strongest 5 or offer another reply.
4. Never pair items merely to equalize group sizes.

Uneven groups are correct when meaning is uneven.

## Caveman-full wording

Apply to headline, anchors, and facts:

- Drop articles: a, an, the.
- Drop copulas and auxiliaries when meaning survives.
- Drop pronouns, filler, pleasantries, and hedging.
- Prefer fragments, short verbs, concrete noun stacks.
- State each fact once.
- Use numerals, not number-words.
- Keep technical meaning complete.

No invented abbreviations: `cfg`, `req`, `fn`, `impl`.
Established acronyms remain valid: DB, API, HTTP.

Too normal:

```text
The pool is able to reuse open database connections, which means
that a new connection does not need to be created for each request.
```

Target:

```text
Pool reuses open DB connections.
No new connection per request.
Handshake cost gone.
```

## Line grammar

- One fact per line.
- Anchor at column 0; 1–4 words.
- Child fact indented 2 spaces; 3–9 words preferred.
- Full sentence inside body rare.
- Target 45–65 visible characters.
- Split before 72 characters when possible.
- Never chain `A → B → C` horizontally.
- Never repeat a fact.
- Indentation must express a real parent-child relationship.

Relations start their own child line:

| Symbol | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `→` | next or result |
| `⇒` | rule |
| `∵` | cause |
| `∴` | conclusion |
| `⚠` | risk |
| `✓` | done or pass |
| `✗` | fail or missing |
| `Δ` | changed |
| `?` | unknown |

Use `·` only for 2–5 nouns sharing one predicate.
Use `|` only for 2–3 alternatives.
Never use separators to create arbitrary visual pairings.
Never invent symbols.

## Boundaries

- Preserve code, commands, URLs, identifiers, and errors byte-exact.
- Preserve user language.
- Keep commits, PRs, docs, and comments in normal conventions.
- Never announce mode unless user asks about mode.

## Gold examples

Short fact:

```text
Port 3000, set in `vite.config.ts`.
```

Diagnosis:

````text
Pool exhaustion causes test failures.

```text
✗ tests
  ∵ connections never released
  ∵ pool exhausted

leaks ×3
  auth middleware
  report generator
  webhook handler
  → wrap each in try/finally

⚠ pool
  5 < load≈40
  → raise after leak fix
```
````

Comparison:

````text
Both integrate branches; history differs.

```text
merge
  keeps both histories
  adds merge commit
  best for shared branch

rebase
  replays local commits
  creates linear history
  rewrites commit hashes

rule
  shared ⇒ merge
  local-only ⇒ rebase
```

Change summary:

Nested artifact handoff:

Artifact ready.

## Settings

In Pi, `/skim capture [note]` saves the last prompt and response for later
skill improvement. Capture only on explicit user command.

`/skim fence on` uses fenced `text` blocks.
`/skim fence off` uses native Markdown bullets.
All limits and Caveman wording remain unchanged.

## Final check

Before sending:

- Caveman wording everywhere?
- No polished introduction?
- 1–5 top-level anchors total?
- 1–5 children per parent?
- Body within default or explicit expanded budget?
- Every grouping semantically real?
- Meaning complete?
